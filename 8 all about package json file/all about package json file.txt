All about package.json file

•	What is package.json file?

The package. json file is the heart of any Node project. It records important metadata about a project which is required before publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package.

•	How to make it?
just write npm init in your terminal.
•	Check the file in detail.
•	Installing external packages.
to install any external package in your node file just type npm I packagename
(npm I nodemon).
•	node js is single threaded or multi-threaded…so it’s single threaded.
